👋 Hi, I’m @K1lluaZk
👀 I’m interested in full-stack development and passionate about programming since a young age, especially game development.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL Server, with plans to start Django soon.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any developer, eager to learn from each project.
📫 How to reach me: [email/DM/Insta]

⚡ Fun fact: My dream is to create a game that others can enjoy, combining everything I love about technology and creativity.
